1 The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite.
2 It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP).
3 Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.
4 TCP is connection-oriented, and a connection between client and server is established before data can be sent.
5 For example, suppose 10,000 bytes are sent in 10 different TCP packets,
6 and the first packet is lost during transmission.
7 In a pure cumulative acknowledgment protocol,
8 the receiver cannot say that it received bytes 1,000 to 9,999 successfully,
9 but failed to receive the first packet, containing bytes 0 to 999.
10 Thus the sender may then have to resend all 10,000 bytes.
11 It is so complicated to implement the protocol!
